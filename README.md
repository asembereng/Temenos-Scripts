- **AD Groups**: 
  - `TEMENOS_ALERT_ADMINS` - Full administrative access
  - `TEMENOS_ALERT_OPERATORS` - Operational access
  - `TEMENOS_ALERT_VIEWERS` - Read-only access
- **Audit Trail**: Tamper-evident logging with payload hashing

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Windows Server 2019+ or Windows 10/11
- .NET 8 SDK
- SQL Server 2019+ (Express, Standard, or Enterprise)
- PowerShell 7.0+
- IIS (for production deployment)

### Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/asembereng/Temenos-Scripts.git
   cd Temenos-Scripts
   ```

2. **Configure database connection**
   ```json
   // src/TemenosAlertManager.Api/appsettings.json
   {
     "ConnectionStrings": {
       "DefaultConnection": "Server=.;Database=TemenosAlertManager;Trusted_Connection=true;"
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Configure remote monitoring (if applicable)**
   ```json
   // For distributed deployments, configure target hosts
   {
     "PowerShell": {
       "RemoteExecutionTimeoutSeconds": 300,
       "UseSecureRemoting": true
     }
   }
   ```

4. **Build and run**
   ```bash
   dotnet build
   cd src/TemenosAlertManager.Api
   dotnet run
   ```

5. **Access the application**
   - API: https://localhost:5001
   - Swagger UI: https://localhost:5001/swagger
   - Hangfire Dashboard: https://localhost:5001/hangfire

### Remote Deployment Setup

For production environments with distributed Temenos systems:

1. **Enable PowerShell Remoting on target hosts**
   ```powershell
   # Run on T24, TPH, MQ, SQL servers
   Enable-PSRemoting -Force
   Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Force
   ```

2. **Configure service accounts**
   - Create dedicated monitoring service accounts
   - Grant minimal required permissions on target systems
   - Configure authentication for cross-host access

3. **Set up network connectivity**
   - Ensure WinRM ports (5985/5986) are accessible
   - Configure firewall rules between Alert Manager and target hosts
   - Test connectivity with `Test-WSMan <target-host>`

4. **Configure monitoring targets**
   - Update database configuration with target host information
   - Configure credentials and connection parameters
   - Test monitoring functions from Alert Manager
