    [HttpPost("eod/start")]  
    public async Task<ActionResult<OperationResultDto>> StartEOD([FromBody] EODRequest request);

    [HttpGet("operations/{operationId}/status")]
    public async Task<ActionResult<OperationStatusDto>> GetOperationStatus(string operationId);

    [HttpPost("services/{serviceId}/start")]
    public async Task<ActionResult<ServiceActionResultDto>> StartService(int serviceId);

    [HttpPost("services/{serviceId}/stop")]
    public async Task<ActionResult<ServiceActionResultDto>> StopService(int serviceId);
